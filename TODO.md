# Pending Tasks

## Completed Tasks

### Dual Database Configuration - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] ~~Updated .env file with both database configurations~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Added AJO_DB_* environment variables for ajo-platform-db~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Enhanced BaseConfig with Ajo database properties~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Created get_ajo_db_connection() function~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Tested both database connections~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Updated test_task11.py to use AJO configuration variables~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Verified all scripts point to correct database variables~~ - COMPLETED

**Configuration:**
- **CWB Database (cwb-database)**: For finhealth functionality - use `get_db_connection()`
- **Ajo Database (ajo-platform-db)**: For Ajo functionality - use `get_ajo_db_connection()`
- Both databases use same credentials but different database names
- Environment variables loaded from root `.env` file

**Scripts verified:**
- `test_task11.py`: Updated to use AJO_DB_* variables ✅
- `functions/database.py`: Provides both connection functions ✅
- Existing finhealth functions: Continue using `get_db_connection()` ✅
- Future Ajo functions: Will use `get_ajo_db_connection()` ✅

### Task 11: Design Ajo-Specific Database Schema - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] ~~Create `database/migrations/` directory~~ - COMPLETED (already existed)
- [x] ~~Design `ajo_groups` table schema~~ - COMPLETED (already existed)
- [x] ~~Design `group_members` table schema~~ - COMPLETED (already existed)
- [x] ~~Design `contributions` table schema~~ - COMPLETED (already existed)
- [x] ~~Design `payments` table schema~~ - COMPLETED (created 004_create_payments_table.sql)
- [x] ~~Create migration script for new tables~~ - COMPLETED (004_create_payments_table.sql)
- [x] ~~Test migration script on clean database~~ - COMPLETED (test_task11.py passes all tests)

**Database:** `ajo-platform-db` contains all required tables:
- `ajo_groups` - Group management with contribution amounts, frequency, members limit
- `group_members` - Membership tracking with roles and payment positions
- `contributions` - Member contribution tracking with payment status
- `payments` - External payment processor integration (Stripe, PayPal, bank transfers)
- `distributions` - Fund distribution to receiving members
- `users` - User accounts and profiles

**Features implemented:**
- Comprehensive foreign key relationships
- Business logic constraints (positive amounts, valid statuses)
- Performance indexes for common queries
- Audit trails with created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Payment provider integration ready for Tasks 36-45
