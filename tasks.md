## Notes for Engineering LLM Agent

1. **Task Isolation**: Each task should be completable independently
2. **Testing Requirements**: Every task must include tests that prove functionality
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation as part of each task
4. **Error Handling**: Include appropriate error handling in each implementation
5. **Security First**: Consider security implications in every task
6. **User Experience**: Ensure each feature contributes to good user experience
7. **Performance**: Consider performance impact of each implementation
8. **Rollback Plan**: Ensure each task can be rolled back if issues arise

Each task should take 2-4 hours to complete, allowing for proper testing and validation before moving to the next task.
