# Pending Tasks

## Completed Tasks

### Dual Database Configuration - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] ~~Updated .env file with both database configurations~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Added AJO_DB_* environment variables for ajo-platform-db~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Enhanced BaseConfig with Ajo database properties~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Created get_ajo_db_connection() function~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Tested both database connections~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Updated test_task11.py to use AJO configuration variables~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Verified all scripts point to correct database variables~~ - COMPLETED

**Configuration:**
- **CWB Database (cwb-database)**: For finhealth functionality - use `get_db_connection()`
- **Ajo Database (ajo-platform-db)**: For Ajo functionality - use `get_ajo_db_connection()`
- Both databases use same credentials but different database names
- Environment variables loaded from root `.env` file

**Scripts verified:**
- `test_task11.py`: Updated to use AJO_DB_* variables ‚úÖ
- `functions/database.py`: Provides both connection functions ‚úÖ
- Existing finhealth functions: Continue using `get_db_connection()` ‚úÖ
- Future Ajo functions: Will use `get_ajo_db_connection()` ‚úÖ

### Task 11: Design Ajo-Specific Database Schema - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] ~~Create `database/migrations/` directory~~ - COMPLETED (already existed)
- [x] ~~Design `ajo_groups` table schema~~ - COMPLETED (already existed)
- [x] ~~Design `group_members` table schema~~ - COMPLETED (already existed)
- [x] ~~Design `contributions` table schema~~ - COMPLETED (already existed)
- [x] ~~Design `payments` table schema~~ - COMPLETED (created 004_create_payments_table.sql)
- [x] ~~Create migration script for new tables~~ - COMPLETED (004_create_payments_table.sql)
- [x] ~~Test migration script on clean database~~ - COMPLETED (test_task11.py passes all tests)

**Database:** `ajo-platform-db` contains all required tables:
- `ajo_groups` - Group management with contribution amounts, frequency, members limit
- `group_members` - Membership tracking with roles and payment positions
- `contributions` - Member contribution tracking with payment status
- `payments` - External payment processor integration (Stripe, PayPal, bank transfers)
- `distributions` - Fund distribution to receiving members
- `users` - User accounts and profiles

**Features implemented:**
- Comprehensive foreign key relationships
- Business logic constraints (positive amounts, valid statuses)
- Performance indexes for common queries
- Audit trails with created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Payment provider integration ready for Tasks 36-45

### Task 28: Group Discovery Interface - Performance Optimization
**üöÄ RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE FIX: Fast Modal with Progressive Enhancement**

**Current Issue:**
- Modal loading delay of ~500ms due to multiple sequential database calls:
  1. User ID lookup from email (`SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = %s`)
  2. Group membership check (`SELECT id FROM group_members WHERE...`)
  3. Group details with aggregation (`SELECT ... COUNT(gm.id) ... GROUP BY ...`)
  4. Member details fetch (`SELECT gm.role, gm.payment_position, u.full_name...`)
  5. Join eligibility check (`can_user_join_group` - 2-3 additional queries)

**Optimization Strategy: "Fast Modal with Progressive Enhancement"**
- ‚úÖ Store user ID in session (eliminate user lookup)
- ‚úÖ Use existing group data for immediate modal display
- ‚úÖ Fetch only member details asynchronously
- ‚úÖ Show loading spinner for member section only

**Expected Impact:**
- üéØ Reduce delay from ~500ms to ~50ms (90% improvement)
- üéØ Maintain all functionality
- üéØ Require minimal code changes
- üéØ Improve user experience significantly

**Implementation Priority:** HIGH - Quick win with major UX impact

## Technical Debt from Task Implementation

### Task 2: Enhanced Password Security - Technical Debt
- [x] ~~Add browser interface for registration~~ - COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Add password confirmation field~~ - COMPLETED  
- [x] ~~Add mode switching between login/register~~ - COMPLETED
- [ ] Replace hardcoded timestamp in `register_user()` with actual datetime
- [ ] Move from in-memory USERS_DB to proper database storage
- [ ] Add email format validation to registration process
- [ ] Consider adding password history to prevent reuse
- [ ] Add password strength meter to UI for better user experience
- [ ] Add form validation feedback in real-time (before submission)

### Group Creation Error Handling - Technical Debt
**Issue:** Misleading error messages mask database connectivity problems
- **Problem**: When internet/database connection fails during group creation, the system shows "User with email {email} not found" instead of indicating a connection problem
- **Root Cause**: `get_user_id_by_email()` in `services/group_service.py` returns `None` for both "user not found" and "database connection failed" scenarios
- **Impact**: Users think their account doesn't exist when the real issue is network connectivity
- **Discovery**: Found during group creation testing when internet was disconnected
- **Current Behavior**: `create_group()` always interprets `None` result as "user not found"
- **Expected Behavior**: Should distinguish between:
  - "Unable to access user database. Please check your internet connection."
  - "User account not found. Please ensure you're logged in correctly."
  - "Database error occurred. Please try again later."
- **Files Affected**: `services/group_service.py` lines 127-150 (get_user_id_by_email) and lines 175-180 (create_group)
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Affects user experience during network issues

### Task 28 - 
- [ ] Add more details to "View Details" - Display group details (members, status, next payment, missed payments, age of members? Restart old group - member since ?? like AirBnB) 
- [ ] View details doesnt lead to details modal in home and group.py 


### Task 29 - 
- [ ] Update correct error message when invites are sent and at other touch points
- [ ] Allow users to send invites via phone number - on click of link if user is registered - sign in, else, sign up - update your profile later
‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Technical Debt (Future Optimization):
Modal loading delay (~500ms) - optimization strategy documented
2 test failures due to Dash framework timing (doesn't affect functionality)
